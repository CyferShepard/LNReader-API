                        The waves roared as the Colossal Kaiju emerged from the ocean, its massive, glowing carapace dripping with seawater. A tsunami wall was created in its wake, smashing into the nearby hills and taken down one of the few lighthouses that stood nearby. The creature that appeared from the depths of the ocean towered at 500 meters, the beast—dubbed "Tidescourge"—released an ear-splitting bellow that exploded with a powerful shockwave that cleared the sky of any clouds. Its six crab-like legs crushed the remains of a seaside city, each step causing tremors that sent cracks splintering across the ground.
                    </p>
<p>
                        From the distance a loud siren blared causing the Colossal Kaiju to turn it's head slightly in the direction of the noise. It's six compound eyes like black rubies reflected no emotion within them as they peered even further.
                    </p>
<p>
                        “Eclipse-7, on standby!” The pilot’s voice crackled over the comms, sharp with adrenaline. Over the cacophony of chaos a colossal size mech appeared darting out of the hillside— It was a sleek, jet-black titan bristling with railguns and plasma blades— unlike the colossal Kaiju it would soon come to face it was considerably smaller at 350 meters making it one of the biggest mechs in the entirety of mech history. It's top speed was slowed down by its massive form, as it approached it took a defensive stance on the cliffside.
                    </p>
<p>
                        “Keep it at range,” the Commander barked over the comm system. “That thing’s armored. Aim for the joints.”
                    </p>
<p>
                        The Kaiju turned its glowing, compound eyes toward the mech. Its maw opened, revealing rows of jagged teeth and strings of thick saliva as it unleashed a concentrated blast of boiling seawater.
                    </p>
<p>
                        One of the pilots screamed in a controlled tone to his copilot. “Incoming!” His copilot gave a much calmer response and nodded.
                    </p>
<p>
                        Eclipse-7’s thrusters roared to life, propelling it sideways just as the torrent slammed into the cliffside. Steam hissed like smoke from molten magma and obscured the battlefield, but the pilots activated the thermal sensors option in their cockpit. Through the haze of red coloured mist they could see the huge form of the Kaiju making a move. Tidescourge, unfazed, charged forward, its immense weight shaking the very ground.
